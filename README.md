# About Magic Card
Made: 2019-10-10
Magic Card Game is a simple card trick game. The user is given 21 cards, amongst those cards the user must choose one random card and the game will ask you only 3 questions and it will figure out the card without being told what card you chose!

Learned how to use basic Arraylists (simple add, get functions)
Found out what Unicode is
And used some basic for loops, while loops etc.

# About Millioniare
Made: 2017
Millioniare is essentially a game inspired by who wants to be a millioniare, this was done back when I was in highschool as a fun class project mini game. I used jforms and basic GUI to implement a buttons and gifs etc. to make a proper working game.

Learned how to use the basics of forms
Learned simple GUI using netbeans
